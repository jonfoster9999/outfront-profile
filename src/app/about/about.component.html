		<hr>
		<p class="text-center">After spending a long time in the world of music, I came across programming when I set out to design a website for a personal project. I instantly became hooked and began exploring ways to further my knowledge of my new passion.</p> 

		<p class="text-center">I spoke to some friends who work in the programming field and they pointed me in the direction of The Flatiron School. I eagerly signed up, and I now know that this was one of the best decisions of my life. Here I learned fundamentals in Ruby, JavaScript, and SQL. These fundamentals built up slowly and methodically into advanced techniques. I also learned about important concepts like object orientation, the single responsibility principle, and test driven development. I enjoyed every minute of absorbing best practices and tempering my own disciplines.</p>

		<p class="text-center">As an employee, I will bring a high degree of enthusiasm, a strong willingness to learn, and a tenacious spirit. I believe in seeing a problem or challenge through until it has found a resolution, and in fact cannot rest until it does. I will be the type of programmer who will leave work at the end of the day and continue to learn.</p>

		<p class="text-center">I am very excited to take my career to the next level and hope that I can be of service at Outfront Media!</p>
